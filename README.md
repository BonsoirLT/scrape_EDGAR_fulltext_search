My code is best for exploring and extracting small sample (you have specific targets and refined keyword).

For bulk execution, it is better to download filing index and search each filing content one by one. A great reference is http://kaichen.work/?p=681 from Professor Kai Chen. He is a great coding mentor for academic research. I learned a lot from him.

There is another sec search engine "https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/srch-edgar".
Pro for that one is that it displays all search results. Con is that it can't select specific filing type.

Feel free to modify my code to fulfill your specific goal. You can leave me your comments/questions on my website: https://www.tong-lu.com/
Enjoy ;)
